# Specifications for the Rails Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Using Ruby on Rails for the project
  - The project is generated by Rails new
- [x] Include at least one has_many relationship (x has_many y e.g. User has_many Recipes)
  - The User has_many portfolios
- [x] Include at least one belongs_to relationship (x belongs_to y e.g. Post belongs_to User)
  - A Portfolios belongs_to a Portfolio
- [x] Include at least one has_many through relationship (x has_many y through z e.g. Recipe has_many Items through Ingredients)
  - A Portfolio has_many coins through coin_portfolios
  - A Coin has_many portfolios through coin_portfolios
- [x] The "through" part of the has_many through includes at least one user submittable attribute (attribute_name e.g. ingredients.quantity)
  - Quantity is the user submittable attribute
- [x] Include reasonable validations for simple model objects (list of model objects with validations e.g. User, Recipe, Ingredient, Item)
  - I've included validations for each model
- [x] Include a class level ActiveRecord scope method (model object & class method name and URL to see the working feature e.g. User.most_recipes URL: /users/most_recipes)
  - Most valued /users/top-portfolios which orders the most valued portfolios in order
- [x] Include a nested form writing to an associated model using a custom attribute writer (form URL, model name e.g. /recipe/new, Item)
  - I have a form for coin_portfolios which is associated with the Coin model
- [x] Include signup (how e.g. Devise)
  - Build my own signup
- [x] Include login (how e.g. Devise)
  - Build my own login with bcrypt
- [x] Include logout (how e.g. Devise)
  - Build my own logout form
- [x] Include third party signup/login (how e.g. Devise/OmniAuth)
  - Using Omniauth so the user can signup through Facebook
- [x] Include nested resource show or index (URL e.g. users/2/recipes)
  - User/2/portfolios index page
- [x] Include nested resource "new" form (URL e.g. recipes/1/ingredients)
  - The nested resource for the new form is on the portfolios page. The coin still get associated to the portfolio but I 
  chose to display the form on the portfolio page instead for a better UX
- [x] Include form display of validation errors (form URL e.g. /recipes/new)
  - I'm including error messages in the form

Confirm:
- [x] The application is pretty DRY
- [x] Limited logic in controllers
- [x] Views use helper methods if appropriate
- [x] Views use partials if appropriate
